python 3.8, 2019a - 0.005 s mean, cannot get at scene/eye images

python 3.7, 2019a - 0.0055 s mean, 0.0038 s median can get at scene/eye images
	Mean roundtrip duration: 7.4 ms

in both cases, need to set python version manually
	- pyversion /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/python3.7

current matlab cost
	- student 69
	- home 119
	- many universities and labs have up-to-date licenses for matlab
	- do we get in trouble since i am using an academic license?

- it seems the packages need to be first loaded into python one time before they become compiled/available to matlab? is this mac specific?
- then restart matlab

- check effect of red battery on eye/scene image quality

for python3.7, need the following:
	opencv-python==4.5.1.48
	opencv-contrib-python==4.5.1.48

for python3.8, need the following:
	opencv-python==4.5.1.48
	opencv-contrib-python==4.5.1.48
