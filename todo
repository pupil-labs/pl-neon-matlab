- what about the 'Error on stream: RTSPConnectionError('RTSP connection lost: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer'). Reconnecting...'
error?

Task exception was never retrieved

- sometimes, if phone display has gone to sleep and you try to start recording and then later stop it, you get this:

>>
    recording_id = device.recording_start();
    disp(['Started recording with id ', recording_id]);

    pause(5);

    device.recording_stop_and_save();
Started recording with id 4a0d68ad-cd62-4fd0-9155-ed55ee8ceefc
