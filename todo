- fix/improve datetime function for octave
- detail what to do about 'ServerDisconnectedError: Server disconnected'
    - check stream option on app, probably shows "waiting for dns service". you need to restart phone?
    - it might ask you again to allow permissions for neon. make sure to select "always"

- and the 'Error on stream: RTSPConnectionError('RTSP connection lost: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer'). Reconnecting...'
error
- also can ignore 'no RTP received for 10 seconds: closing'? it caused matlab to lock up
- also can ignore 'error on received data: InvalidStateError'? this one was odd and verbose
